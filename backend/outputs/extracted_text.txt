Climate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 19 Climate change is considered a material risk for Nestlé. Within our Enterprise Risk Management framework, we conduct an annual assessment of climate change risks and review the
strategy and plans to mitigate them. We assess related financial risks using a discounted cash flow methodology.
Impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities Pages 9 to 11
Our assessment establishes:
Resilience of the organization’s strategy Pages 9 to 11
– Transition risks: we have assessed transition risks to 2030, based on exposure levels from low-, intermediate- and high-emission pathways. Modeling results show a degree of
exposure, but our Net Zero Roadmap could reduce this by up to half.
Risk management – Physical risks: changing temperatures and weather extremes can affect the quality and availability of key raw materials through lower and variable yields, as well as shifts in the
regions suitable for cultivation. For 12 key ingredients covering 90% of our spend, we estimated the yield change in 2040 versus today in a ‘steady-state', intermediate climate scenario

(+2 to 3 °C by 2100), discounting the unpredictable impacts of extreme events.

Nestlé is well positioned to implement nature-based solutions for less resource-intense and more resilient food production, as it has direct access to more than 500 000 farmers. One

as 2022. This KPI measures the performance of volumes at origin level against the requirements of the Nestlé Responsible Sourcing Standard
and the progressive delivery of positive impacts on people, nature and climate in Nestlé’s sourcing origins. Priority raw materials refers to
14 key agricultural raw materials that cover 95% of our annual sourcing by volume: cereals and grains; cocoa; coconut; coffee; dairy; fish and
seafood; hazelnuts; meat, poultry and eggs; palm oil; pulp and paper; soy; spices; sugar; and vegetables.
7 In 2023, the following ingredients are included in the numerator: dairy (fresh milk and dairy derivatives), coffee (excluding blended green coffee
and blue bottle), cocoa, cereals and grains, soy and vegetables. The denominator includes all raw materials in scope: coffee, cocoa, dairy,
sugar, cereals and grains, meat, poultry and eggs, palm oil, soy, vegetables, fish and seafood.
